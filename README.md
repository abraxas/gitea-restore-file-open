# gitea-restore-file-open

**Gitea** `1.27.3` - Gitea

[CVE-2026-59765](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/security/advisories/GHSA-2wm4-vwp6-v7xc) put a hostmatcher HTTP client on [`OpenWithClient`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/modules/uri/uri.go). The `file://` branch ignores that client and calls `os.Open`. Restore of a dump has no `DownloadFunc`. [`gitea_uploader.go`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/services/migrations/gitea_uploader.go) then opens the rewritten `file://` URL. `os.Open` follows a **dump-side symlink**. Join stays under the dump. The symlink does not.

**Operator restore of an untrusted dump copies the symlink target into a release attachment. As the Gitea uid, that is any file the service account can read.**

## What an attacker can do

Hand an admin an untrusted dump (a "backup" directory, a restore from an untrusted remote) that contains a **symlink** under the joined-under-dump path. Restore copies the **target file** into a release attachment on the restored repo. Whoever can read that repo downloads it.

If the dump author names `app.ini`, that is credential theft (`INTERNAL_TOKEN`, `SECRET_KEY`, JWT, DB password). Lab oracle was a planted witness file, not `app.ini`. It is not OS LPE. It is not unauthenticated. It is not dump-root join escape. Live migrate from GitHub/GitLab/Gitea sets `DownloadFunc` and does **not** `os.Open` an attacker `file://`.

## How I found it

Two restore maps sat on the leftover table. I labbed the obvious one first.

Finding 8 was dump-root join escape: put an absolute `DownloadURL` in `release.yml`, hope [`FilePathJoinAbs`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/modules/util/path.go) drops the dump prefix the way naive `filepath.Join(base, "/etc/passwd")` does. On 1.27.3 it does not. Each `sub` is `filepath.Clean("/"+s)` then `filepath.Join(base, cleaned)`. Replica join of `/tmp/dump` + `/tmp/GITEA-JOIN-OUTSIDE` stayed `/tmp/dump/tmp/GITEA-JOIN-OUTSIDE`. Restore rewrote `file://` under the dump and failed `open ...: no such file or directory`. That is not join-escape on this tag.

Finding 9 is what landed. I planted a witness file outside the dump, put a symlink at the joined-under-dump path, ran `gitea restore-repo`. Restore rc=0. The restored release attachment contained `GITEA-FILE-OPEN-WITNESS`.

Wrong turns already recorded: dump-root join escape via an absolute `DownloadURL`; live migrate `file://` LFI; `X-Gitea-Internal-Auth` (restore is CLI as the Gitea uid, not `/api/internal`); treating restore HTTP as remote unauth (CVSS is local, high privilege, user interaction); a reverse shell. Theatre.

## Lab

```bash
cd lab
./run.sh
```

Target **only** `http://127.0.0.1:18137`. Compose mounts `lab/dump` read-only. `run.sh` plants the witness inside the container, builds the dump, puts the symlink, then `gitea restore-repo`.

```text
restore-rc=0 Restore repo labadmin/restored successfully
download status=200 snippet=GITEA-FILE-OPEN-WITNESS
SUCCESS GITEA-RESTORE-FILE-OPEN
```

## The fix

Drop `file://` from `OpenWithClient`, or refuse to follow dump symlinks, and do not restore untrusted dumps. Restored attachment must not contain the out-of-dump witness.
